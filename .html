<p>I just wanted to let you know that you are my very favorite and the bestest thing that's ever happened to me.  You are by far the sweetest and most caring person I've ever met, hehe, but you're like an M&amp;M, you're all tough on the outside (or you try to be :) ) but super sweet and nice on the inside.  I have had an amazing time with you thus far and really look forward to all of the cool things we will get to do together in the future.  I love you and you really are my soulmate and I am very ecstatic(or some other word that means a lot more than happy) that we found each other!!!</p>
